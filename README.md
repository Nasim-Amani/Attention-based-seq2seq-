# Electricity Load Forecasting Using Weather-Sensitive Attention Mechanism and Bayesian Optimization

This repository contains a machine learning model for load forecasting, utilizing an attention-based sequence-to-sequence architecture. The model's hyperparameters are optimized through Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques to enhance performance.

## **Model Overview**

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Encoder**: Processes the input sequence.
- **Decoder**: Generates the output sequence using the encoder's output and an attention mechanism.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Employed to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of layers, dropout rates, and learning rate.
